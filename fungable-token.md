# Learn rust with NEAR

[fungable token](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/examples/fungible-token): Example implementation of a Fungible Token contract which uses [near-contract-standards](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-contract-standards) and [simulation](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-sdk-sim).

---

## Variables and constant

Rust has variables like any other language such as primatives and non-primatives and there are some special features we will disscus them one by one.

----

### [struct](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html)

```rs=32
pub struct Contract {
    token: FungibleToken,
    metadata: LazyOption<FungibleTokenMetadata>,
}
```

Rust doesn't have classes but instead struct to define a container for data like in these line of code we define a struct with two variables 'token' and 'metadata'.

----

### [enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html)

```rs=40
enum StorageKey {
    FungibleToken,
    Metadata,
}
```

Rust has enums to give names to const variables in additions other featurs we will explore them in next lessons like in this code we define new type called 'StorageKey' with two possibilities 'FungibleToken' and 'Metadata'.

----

### [const](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html)

```rs=37
const DATA_IMAGE_SVG_NEAR_ICON: &str = "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 288 288'%3E%3Cg id='l' data-name='l'%3E%3Cpath d='M187.58,79.81l-30.1,44.69a3.2,3.2,0,0,0,4.75,4.2L191.86,103a1.2,1.2,0,0,1,2,.91v80.46a1.2,1.2,0,0,1-2.12.77L102.18,77.93A15.35,15.35,0,0,0,90.47,72.5H87.34A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,72,87.84V201.16A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,87.34,216.5h0a15.35,15.35,0,0,0,13.08-7.31l30.1-44.69a3.2,3.2,0,0,0-4.75-4.2L96.14,186a1.2,1.2,0,0,1-2-.91V104.61a1.2,1.2,0,0,1,2.12-.77l89.55,107.23a15.35,15.35,0,0,0,11.71,5.43h3.13A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,216,201.16V87.84A15.34,15.34,0,0,0,200.66,72.5h0A15.35,15.35,0,0,0,187.58,79.81Z'/%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E";
```

Rust has compile time const that recommended to be used with values that used many times in addition to it gives readablity for the code, for example here we define a const for image csv value that might be used many times in the program.

---

## [strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/str.html)

rust has many types that represents sequence of characters

----

### [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/index.html)

```rs=56
 name: "Example NEAR fungible token".to_string(),
```

String is a UTF-8 dynamic groupable list used to store sequence of chars, and we here we call [to_string](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html) to get String from the variable of type '&str' we will check it next page

----

### [&str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html)

```rs=56
 name: "Example NEAR fungible token".to_string(),
```

it is slice version of String so it reference to other type of String ,here we are haveing a string literal of type '&'static str' and this mean it reference to a string with static [lifetime](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html) which will live all program lifetime

---

## functions

like any other language you can define some reusable code and it is called function.

----

### function definition and calling

```rs=109
 fn get_context(predecessor_account_id: AccountId) -> VMContextBuilder {
     let mut builder = VMContextBuilder::new();
     builder
         .current_account_id(accounts(0))
         .signer_account_id(predecessor_account_id.clone())
         .predecessor_account_id(predecessor_account_id);
     builder
 }
```

here we are defining a function with name 'get_context', parameter and return type, also at lines 111th to 114 we call functions in a variable called 'builder' and they are [instance functions](https://turreta.com/2019/10/14/static-and-instance-methods-in-struct/) but we will learn them in the next section.

---

## impl section, and static and instance functions

Rust is not object oriented language but you can define structs as data container and attach function to operate on this data, also you can do the same for enums.

----

### [impl](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.impl.html)

```rs=46
impl Contract {
```

here we start to define functions to manipulate the derived type

----

### [static function](https://turreta.com/2019/10/14/static-and-instance-methods-in-struct/)

```rs=69
 pub fn new(owner_id: AccountId, total_supply: U128, metadata: FungibleTokenMetadata) -> Self {
```

inside impl block we can define a static function like this so it can be called from the type itself, here we are returning [Self](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32304595/whats-the-difference-between-self-and-self) from the function so here we refere to the current type.

----

### [static function](https://turreta.com/2019/10/14/static-and-instance-methods-in-struct/) call

```rs=110
 let mut builder = VMContextBuilder::new();
```

here we call a static function 'new' in the type 'VMContextBuilder' and this is widely used method to create a new instance because Rust doesn't have constractor.

----

### [instance function](https://turreta.com/2019/10/14/static-and-instance-methods-in-struct/)

```rs=81
 fn on_account_closed(&mut self, account_id: AccountId, balance: Balance) {
     log!("Closed @{} with {}", account_id, balance);
 }
```

inside impl block we can define instance function like this code defines function that takes parameters in addition to '& mut [self](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.self.html)', rust introduce new concept called [mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html) so here we borrow mutable refrence for the current object so that the function can edit on it.

----

### instance function and immutable reference

```rs=95
 fn ft_metadata(&self) -> FungibleTokenMetadata {
     self.metadata.get().unwrap()
 }
```

here we define an instance function with '&self' this means the function [borrows](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html) the current object for readonly like in 96th line we use it to get data from 'metadata' variable.

----

### instance function calling

```rs=110
 let mut builder = VMContextBuilder::new();
 builder
     .current_account_id(accounts(0))
     .signer_account_id(predecessor_account_id.clone())
     .predecessor_account_id(predecessor_account_id);
```

line 112 to 114 calling instance function on the variable 'builder' and these lines follows [builder pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html)

---

## [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/move.html) and [borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html)

rust has unique concept called ownership and borrowing so when you assign variables to anther so most of the time instead of copying, the ownership taken by the second variable, so we can use borrowing and other things so keep the origin variable

----

### [Clone](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) and ownership

```rs=113
 .signer_account_id(predecessor_account_id.clone())
 .predecessor_account_id(predecessor_account_id);
```

as we mention when we use a variable in passing to function or to assign anther variable so the ownership is transfered and the origin variable move and this exist with non-primative types unless they implement [Copy trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html), so in line 13 we use clone function to make a copy of data and pass it so that we could use the original variable in the next line to be passed to the function.

---

## [testing in rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html)

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner.

----

### unit test

```rs=118
 #[test]
 fn test_new() {
     let mut context = get_context(accounts(1));
     testing_env!(context.build());
     let contract = Contract::new_default_meta(accounts(1).into(), TOTAL_SUPPLY.into());
     testing_env!(context.is_view(true).build());
     assert_eq!(contract.ft_total_supply().0, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
     assert_eq!(contract.ft_balance_of(accounts(1)).0, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
 }
```

so here we are writing a function and anntotate it as test like in line 118, and we use assertion funtions like at lines 124 and 125

---

## [modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/mod.html) and [imports](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/use-declarations.html)

Rust structure it's code in modules so you can have mutliple files in your projects.

----

### importing from other crates

```rs=18
use near_contract_standards::fungible_token::metadata::{
    FungibleTokenMetadata, FungibleTokenMetadataProvider, FT_METADATA_SPEC,
};
use near_contract_standards::fungible_token::FungibleToken;
```

these lines import struct types from other crates that must be mentioned as a dependence in [Cargo.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

----

### modules

```rs=100
#[cfg(all(test, not(target_arch = "wasm32")))]
mod tests {
```

we can define new module in rust to structure our code, here we declaring a module at line 101 ,and at line 100 we annotate that it is a test module and use a [compile time switch](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html) to compile this module only at non-WASM platform.

----

### using code from other modules

```rs=142
 .storage_usage(env::storage_usage())
```

to use code like function from other modules you can use full qualified name like in this code we call function from 'env' module

---

## [macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html)

Macros are widely used in metaprogramming for generating code at compile time.

----

### [procedure macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html)

```rs=30
#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize, PanicOnDefault)]
```

procedure macros allow creating syntax extentions like at line 30 we attribute the that this struct should generate some code for near, at line 31 [derive-macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/derive.html) to generate implementation for these traits instead of making custom implementation for them.[BorshDeserialize](https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/de/trait.BorshDeserialize.html), [BorshSerialize](https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/de/trait.BorshSerialize.html) are used to convert to and from object and binary value but Serialize and Deserialize are used to convert to and from object and json value.

----

### [macro rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/macros.html)

```rs=82
 log!("Closed @{} with {}", account_id, balance);
```

macro rules it is a macro like function but evaluated at compile time in addition to have ability to generate codes, this line call macro and as we see it is like function call but have '!' so here we call macro called [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) to log some information to be traced later
